ideas, problems, misc:

problem: trace sometimes snaps to intersection when pressing against outer border
problem: line can pass through outer border

idea: to test if line on a finish point, check if either gridpos is further than maze size


To Do:
add nullzone for trace start once line goes over another intersection
add nullzones for line body in trymove()
add maze border nullzones

further down the line:
check if variables need to be self.var or just var
solution checking: [SPOILERS FOR THE WITNESS PUZZLE MECHANICS BELOW]
 - hexagons can be checked simply by analyzing trace path upon finishing
use left/right of line algorithm to separate grid into groups, for all white/black squares check if any of other color in group
for tetrominoes analyze the group the tetromino is in
"learning mode" aka wrong elements flash when wrong?
make intersection snapping moving to intersection instead of snapping
 - maybe intersection checking needs to happen first in update() to prevent oscillation like last time I tried this
