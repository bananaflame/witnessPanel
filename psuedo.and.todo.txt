ideas, problems, misc:

problem: trace sometimes snaps to intersection when pressing against outer border

idea: line start is circle that grows bigger, created in constructor of Trace *and added to the trace body sprite list* so it keeps getting drawn
 - working on this ^, was going to have the tracestarts be purely graphical because you can go through them in the beginning of the trace,
   but then I remembered that the trace head collides with the sides of the trace start if you loop around and touch it
   one solution to this might be to have an invisible sprite associated with the trace start that only counts for collisions if
   the trace has gone through one intersection, gotta figure out how to do that though

To Do:
add finish functionality to maze data
add intersection sprites for collisions at maze intersections, as well as hexagon sprites (wait, maybe just hexagon sprites?)
 - maybe don't do this ^ but find a way to store trace path
    - going to have a trace body object that updates with info from trace head every frame
      *checking for intersection passing and hexagon coverage needs to happen during trymove though so nothing is jumped over*
draw line body based on occupied intersections, and stretch active dimension of a "current" rectangle surface as line head moves

further down the line:
check if variables need to be self.var or just var
solution checking: [SPOILERS FOR THE WITNESS PUZZLE MECHANICS BELOW]
 - hexagon sprites all collide with line segments
use left/right of line algorithm to separate grid into groups, for all white/black squares check if any of other color in group
for tetrominoes analyze the group the tetromino is in
"learning mode" aka wrong elements flash when wrong?
make intersection snapping moving to intersection instead of snapping
