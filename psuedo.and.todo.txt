ideas, problems, misc:

problem: trace sometimes snaps to intersection when pressing against outer border

idea: line start is circle that grows bigger, created in constructor of Trace *and added to the trace body sprite list* so it keeps getting drawn

To Do:
add start and finish functionality to maze data
add intersection sprites for collisions at maze intersections, as well as hexagon sprites (wait, maybe just hexagon sprites?)
 - maybe don't do this ^ but find a way to store trace path
draw line body based on occupied intersections, and stretch active dimension of a "current" rectangle surface as line head moves

further down the line:
check if variables need to be self.var or just var
solution checking: [SPOILERS FOR THE WITNESS PUZZLE MECHANICS BELOW]
 - hexagon sprites all collide with line segments
use left/right of line algorithm to separate grid into groups, for all white/black squares check if any of other color in group
for tetrominoes analyze the group the tetromino is in
"learning mode" aka wrong elements flash when wrong?
